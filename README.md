# SmartMic

ESPHome firmware for DIY voice satellites paired with Home Assistant Assist.

## Devices

| File | Role | Hardware | Wake word | Notes |
|------|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| `smartmic.yaml` | **Fleet firmware** — single image flashes to any number of SmartMic units | XIAO ESP32-S3 (8 MB flash, octal PSRAM) + 1× I2S MEMS mic (**INMP441** or **ICS-43434**, drop-in pin-compatible, mono on left channel — L/R → GND) + onboard LED on GPIO4 | `hey_jarvis` (microWakeWord, on-device) | `name_add_mac_suffix: true` → each device auto-names `smartmic-<last6mac>`. Timer ring derives `satellite_entity_id` at runtime from `App.get_name()`, so one .bin works for the whole fleet. TTS via [Mic to MediaPlayer](https://github.com/bigbabol1/HomeAssistant_mic_to_mediaplayer). |
| `seeed-mic1.yaml` | Legacy single-device firmware (kept for the deployed `seeed-mic1` unit) | Same hardware, **right channel** (L/R → VDD) | `hey_jarvis` | Hardcoded name `seeed-mic1` + hardcoded `satellite_entity_id`. New builds should use `smartmic.yaml` instead. |

## Pinout (XIAO ESP32-S3)

| Pin | Function |
|-----|----------|
| GPIO7 | I2S BCLK |
| GPIO8 | I2S LRCLK / WS |
| GPIO9 | I2S DIN (mic data) |
| GPIO4 | Status LED (active low) |

## Microphone modules (drop-in compatible)

Both supported MEMS mics share the I2S Philips protocol, 24-bit MSB in 32-bit frame, and identical 6-pin layout. No firmware changes are required when swapping — only update the `mic_module` substitution at the top of the YAML for log clarity.

| Module | SNR (dBA) | Sensitivity | Built-in HPF | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| INMP441 | 61 | -26 dBFS @ 94 dB SPL | No | Original board fitment; small DC offset present in raw stream. |
| ICS-43434 | 65 | -26 dBFS @ 94 dB SPL | Yes (~80 Hz) | Default for new builds; cleaner low-frequency baseline, slightly better wake-word recall in noisy rooms. |

**Wiring:** L/R pad → VDD selects the right slot (`channel: right` — used by legacy `seeed-mic1.yaml`). L/R → GND selects the left slot (`channel: left` — standard for new builds, used by `smartmic.yaml`).

## Companion stack

These satellites are designed to work with the full voice stack:

1. **This firmware** — wake word + audio capture, sends audio to HA pipeline.
2. **[Mic to MediaPlayer](https://github.com/bigbabol1/HomeAssistant_mic_to_mediaplayer)** — captures TTS audio from the pipeline and plays it on a configured `media_player` (e.g. AirPlay speaker, TV, Alexa). Also drives the `start_follow_up` ESPHome service for `continue_conversation` follow-up turns without re-triggering the wake word.
3. **[AI Plugin](https://github.com/bigbabol1/AI-plugin)** — LLM-backed Home Assistant conversation entity (Ollama/OpenAI/Anthropic), with tool calling for entity discovery, area control, web search, weather forecast and persistent user-fact memory.

## Tunable runtime parameters

The YAML exposes several `number` entities so you can tune behaviour from the HA UI without re-flashing:

| Entity | Range | Default | Effect |
|--------|-------|---------|--------|
| Geräuschunterdrückung (Noise Suppression) | 0–4 | 2 | ESPHome built-in noise suppression strength. |
| Auto-Gain (dBFS) | 0–31 | 24 | Target loudness for automatic gain control. |
| Mikrofon-Verstärkung (Volume Multiplier) | 0.5–12.0 | 2.0 | Linear gain multiplier applied after AGC. |
| Wake Probability Cutoff | 0.30–0.95 | 0.50 | microWakeWord detection threshold. Higher = fewer false wakes, more misses. |
| Wake Sliding Window | 1–20 | 10 | Number of consecutive frames to consider for wake-word voting. **Requires recompile.** |

Two switches let you mute the mic (`Mikrofon stumm`) or disable wake-word detection entirely (`Wake Word Detection`). State is restored across reboots.

## Build / flash

The YAMLs are intended for the ESPHome Home Assistant add-on:

1. Place `smartmic.yaml` (or `seeed-mic1.yaml` for the legacy unit) in `/config/esphome/`.
2. Provide `wifi_ssid` and `wifi_password` in `/config/esphome/secrets.yaml`.
3. ESPHome dashboard → device → **Install** (USB for first flash, OTA afterwards).

If the HA add-on host runs out of RAM during compile (low-spec HA boxes are common), build externally:

```bash
docker run --rm --network host -v "$PWD:/config" -w /config ghcr.io/esphome/esphome:latest \
  run smartmic.yaml --device <ip-or-mdns-name> --no-logs
```

For first flash of a brand-new unit, generate the factory image and flash via [web.esphome.io](https://web.esphome.io):

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/config" -w /config ghcr.io/esphome/esphome:latest compile smartmic.yaml
# → .esphome/build/smartmic/.pioenvs/smartmic/firmware.factory.bin
```

`secrets.yaml` and `*.bak-*` backups are intentionally not committed.

## Architecture notes

- **Pattern B satellite** — no local audio sink. The HA pipeline's `continue_conversation` flow needs help: `start_follow_up` API service (defined under `api.services`) is invoked by Mic to MediaPlayer after TTS playback ends, which calls `voice_assistant.start` so the firmware re-enters STT without another wake-word detection.
- **Loudness sensor** — a callback on the I2S mic stream computes a smoothed dBFS RMS estimate, surfaced as `sensor.mikrofon_loudness_dbfs` for diagnostics.
- **State text sensor** — `Bereit` / `Hört zu` / `Verarbeite` / `Antwortet` / `Stumm` / `Aus` / `Fehler` for use in dashboards.
- **Voice timer hooks** — `on_timer_started/finished/cancelled/updated` integrate with the HA built-in voice timer (`HassStartTimer` etc.). On `finished`, the firmware calls `mic_to_mediaplayer.announce` with the timer name; Mic2MP routes the speech to the bound speaker (with `announce: true` so any current music is ducked).
- **Fleet naming (`smartmic.yaml`)** — `name: smartmic` + `name_add_mac_suffix: true` produces `smartmic-<last6mac>` per device. The timer hook resolves `satellite_entity_id` at runtime via a lambda that reads `App.get_name()` and substitutes `-` → `_`, yielding `assist_satellite.<runtime_name>_assist_satellit` (HA German `object_id_base` "Assist-Satellit"). One firmware image, N devices, no per-device recompile.
